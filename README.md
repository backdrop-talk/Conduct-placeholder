# Conduct-placeholder
Placeholder for the Conduct repo inside /backdrop-ops

This will be the place where discussions about the code-of-conduct are held and the policies that dictate what the community can expect from each other.

(this repo lives within /backdrop-ops/conduct and needs to be transfered here)
